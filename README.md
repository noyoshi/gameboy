# Gameboy Emulator

The goal for this project is to create a simple gameboy emulator for the 1st gen gameboy (and then extend it to gameboy color).

## Development plan

I am planning on splitting up the files logically, with a cartridge file, a processor file, ...

I Think most of the stuff for the processor and cartidges can be found in the Full manual referenced below.

### TODO 
- [ ] Implement writing from the tilemap to the SDL screen

## Example project (CHIP-8 Emulator)

Here is a proof of concept I did recently which got me really excited to make this: https://github.com/sambattalio/chip8_emu
